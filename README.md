In this project, the Sorted ArrayList and the Red Black Tree are closely observed in order to determine the optimal data
structure between the two. Specifically, the methods tested in this experiment are both data structures' insert methods as
well as their getKth methods. The insert method is the insertion of an element in its proper natural order and the 
getKth method returns the kth smallest element present in the data structure. The Sorted ArrayList and all of its methods were
coded in this project but the Red Black Tree code was referenced and proper modifications were made in order to obtain the 
desired features. This project has an input generator method that generates an input file with specific scenarios to test the 
described methods. Three separate experiments were conducted with one having 50% add methods and 50% getKth methods, another 
having 90% add methods and 10% getKth methods, and the last having 10% add methods and 90% getKth methods. Each one of these 
experiments also had different input sizes of one hundred thousand, five hundred thousand, and a million elements. After 
running these experiments, the data obtained was analyzed and the optimal data structure was determined.
